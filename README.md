Banking Customers churn prediction Application
=====

## Project Description:
The **Banking Customers Churn Prediction Application** is a dynamic university project focused on applying data science techniques to solve real-world challenges in the banking sector. Our mission is to develop a sophisticated web application capable of predicting customer churn in real-time using intricate customer data. Through collaborative efforts, we've built a solution that simulates real production scenarios, showcasing the application of machine learning in a dynamic business environment.

## Tasks Accomplished as Data Scientist:
- Conducted comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to unveil valuable insights from the dataset.
- Collected, cleaned, and prepared data for model training, ensuring data integrity and reliability.
- Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.
- Utilized metrics such as confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC to assess model performance and iteratively refine the models.
- Integrated the machine learning model into the web application's backend using FastAPI, ensuring seamless functionality and real-time predictions.
